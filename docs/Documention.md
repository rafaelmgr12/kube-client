## Overview
The `kube-client` repository provides a client for Kubernetes, allowing users to interact with Kubernetes clusters programmatically. The repository contains code for deployment operations, Kubernetes client configurations, error handling, and integration tests.

---

## Key Components

### Deployment

#### `deployment/model.go`
This file defines the data structures and models related to Kubernetes deployments.
- `Deployment`: Represents a Kubernetes deployment with fields like `Name`, `Namespace`, `Labels`, and `Replicas`.

#### `deployment/service.go`
This file provides services and functions to interact with Kubernetes deployments.
- `CreateDeployment`: Creates a new Kubernetes deployment.
- `DeleteDeployment`: Deletes an existing Kubernetes deployment.
- `GetDeployment`: Retrieves details of a specific Kubernetes deployment.

---

### Kubernetes Client

#### `kube/client.go`
This file provides functions to create and configure a Kubernetes client.
- `NewClient`: Initializes a new Kubernetes client.
- `NewClientFromConfig`: Initializes a new Kubernetes client using a specific configuration.

#### `kube/client_test.go`
Contains unit tests for the Kubernetes client functions.

#### `kube/errors/error_api.go`
Defines custom error types and handling for the Kubernetes client.
- `ErrNotFound`: Error indicating a resource was not found.
- `ErrAlreadyExists`: Error indicating a resource already exists.

#### `kube/option.go`
Provides options and configurations for the Kubernetes client.

---

## Integration Tests

#### `tests/integrations/deployment_create_test.go`
Contains integration tests for creating Kubernetes deployments.

#### `tests/integrations/deployment_delete_test.go`
Contains integration tests for deleting Kubernetes deployments.

#### `tests/integrations/deployment_get_test.go`
Contains integration tests for retrieving Kubernetes deployments.

---

## Usage
To use the `kube-client`, you would typically start by initializing a Kubernetes client using the provided functions. Once the client is initialized, you can perform various operations on Kubernetes deployments using the services defined in the `deployment` package.

---

## Testing
The repository contains both unit and integration tests. To run the tests, navigate to the respective test file and execute the tests using the standard Go testing commands.

---

## Contribution
Contributions to the `kube-client` repository are welcome. Before making a contribution, it's recommended to go through the codebase to understand the structure and design patterns used.

---

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the `kube-client` repository. For detailed implementation and usage, it's recommended to refer to the codebase directly.
